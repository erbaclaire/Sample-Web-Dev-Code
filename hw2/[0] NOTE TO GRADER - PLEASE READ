NOTES TO GRADER:

- I've noticed that if I open up the mobile view, my browser sometimes doesn't recognize that it is in a mobile view. If this happens, click "responsive" and then "iPhone X" and it should look right. If that doesn't work, re-open in an incognito tab.
- I understand that the mobile specifications did not apply to tablets/iPads.
- I understand that on mobile we can have scroll to see the remainder of the page and the only thing that matters is the order of the elements. 
- Make sure your zoom is set to 100% or less if you can't see all of my Desktop page. Scroll is disabled on purpose.

Thanks!

Claire
