NOTE TO GRADER:

- I've noticed that if I open up the mobile view, my browser sometimes doesn't recognize that it is in a mobile view. I have to click on the display and phone type a bunch to get it to recognize it is in mobile view. It works in an incognito browser, though.
- I swear it looks right on mobile, so please click around if it is not recognizing it for you or try opening in an incognito window.


Thanks!

Claire
